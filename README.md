## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

For this assignment, the entire application logic is contained within `src/App.tsx` for simplicity and ease of review.

```
/
|-- public/
|-- src
|   |-- App.tsx         # Main component with all logic and sub-components
|   |-- index.css       # Tailwind CSS setup and global styles
|   +-- main.tsx        # Entry point for the React app
|-- package.json
+-- README.md
```

-   **`App.tsx`**: Contains all components, state management, API calls, and type definitions. In a larger application, components, types, and API logic would be split into separate files and folders for better organization.
